# Premier League Web PAge Design Using Basic Web Technologies (HTML, JS, CSS)
A Premier League website made for my mini project, it makes use of all the front end web technologies - HTML, Javascript and CSS, the backend is not fully focused on but a basic implementation of Login and Sign-up is made using PHP and SQL.

The logout feature on the backend is a pseudo one , in other words, it actually doesn't work, it redirects you to a duplicate page which doesn't show your name as it does when you are logged in.

# Start with the homepage.html ( not homepage2.html, it needs a database to be created to work properly).
and naivigate to whereveer you want.

For the sign up and Login to work, the database with the following details has to be created-

Database name- pl

table name- users

number of columns- 8.

colums names-
  id (with auto increment),
  first,
  last,
  mail,
  team,
  username,
  password,
  pp
 
 That's it! Once you have set up the database , you can start using the backe3nd features too. 
 
 This project is shared to help you with your project, it is to be taken as an example and not to be plagiarized.
